# Liferay Patch Download Script
Do you enjoy navigating the private files of Liferay in order to download that specific hotfix or patch for DXP?  This script is **NOT** for you!

This script has been setup so that you can quickly download the fixes that you need without opening a browser!

## Pre-requisite
This script makes use of the `~/.netrc` file in order to hide away your username and password for the private LR files.

1. Create ~/.netrc file.
2. Setup with the following lines:

```
machine files.liferay.com
login user.name
password liferay123
```

3. Save the file and close.

4. **Optional** (but highly reccommended) - to make it so that only YOU can open up this file which contains your password perform the following: `chmod 400 ~/.netrc` - this makes it so that only the owner-user can access it and nobody else can.  So keep your computer locked!

## Setup

1. Copy the contents of the 'dlfix.sh' into your bash profile
2. Save
3. Source your profile!

## How to Use

1. Navigate to your Liferay Home directory or patching-tool folder.
2. Call the function 'dlfix'

## Example

```

1) 7010  2) 7110  3) 7210
?# 2

You have selected  7110.
