Depending on the _current severity_ and _state_ of a HC ticket, there are different steps that need to be taken before being able to escalate a ticket to DXPC Engineering.

~~There are many ways to escalate an issue with the DXP Cloud product. The process you should follow depends on the current severity and state of the issue. This article documents the various escalation processes and when they should be used.~~

## Escalation Workflows ~~General~~
The following processes are available for DXP Cloud Product issues.

- [Standard Escalation Process](#standard-escalation-process)
- [Sev 0 & Sev 1 Critical Escalation Process](#sev-0--sev-1-critical-escalation-process)
- [DXP Cloud Global Critical Tickets](#global-critical-ticket-rotations)
- [Escalations Outside of Support](#escalations-outside-of-support)
- ~~[Mitigating External Escalations](#mitigating-external-escalations)~~

~~### Details~~

### Standard Escalation Process

#### When should I use this workflow?

When a CSE has performed their initial investigation and testing(following the [DXP Cloud Reproducing Issues Process](https://grow.liferay.com/people/Liferay+DXP+Cloud+-+Reproducing+Issues)) and has determined that there is a bug or issue the Product Team needs to address.

#### What do I do?
You can find the process here:
[DXP Cloud Standard Escalation](https://grow.liferay.com/people/DXP+Cloud+Standard+Escalation)

### Sev 0 & Sev 1 Critical Escalation Process

#### When should I use this workflow?
When a customer issue has the Priority set to High. 

#### What do I do?
The CSE should follow the [DXP Cloud Reproducing Issues Process](https://grow.liferay.com/people/Liferay+DXP+Cloud+-+Reproducing+Issues), but it may be necessary to escalate the issue further due to the impact on the customer.

### Global Critical Ticket Rotations

#### When should I use this workflow?
When a ticket is still critical at the end of the business day in your region. 

#### What do I do?
The CSE should forward the ticket to the next region in the rotation.

### Escalations Outside of Support (Third-Party Escalations)

#### When should I use this workflow?
When a customer reaches out to their contacts outside of the Support team. This can be via email, call, or other means. 

#### What do I do?
Verify the third-party contact (who receives the communication from the customer) has reviewed the below article, following the steps listed. Depending on the process in the specific region, the CSE may also need to use the Customer Urgent macro on the associated Zendesk ticket.

## Best Practices for Managing Escalations

#### When should I use these Best Practices?
- When a customer expresses **on the HC ticket** that the issue is hot or urgent and needs to be prioritized.

- When a ticket that has already been escalated to the DXPC engineering team needs to be re-prioritized.
