There are a number of ways to escalate a customer issue. Customers know that, if Support is not addressing an issue at the rate or manner the desire, they can reach out to other individuals or departments outside of Support to push their issue forward. 

It is our job in Support to reduce/mitigate these external escalations(if an external escalation should occur, please follow [this process](https://grow.liferay.com/share/Escalating+DXP+Cloud+Issues+Outside+of+Support)).  We can do this by initiating our escalation management process.

### General
Tickets can become "hot" for various reasons. We are able to increase the priority of hot DXP Cloud tickets if the team is informed in the appropriate way. If a customer expresses concerns about the priority of their issue, the pacing of the investigation, frustrations about the Support process or other related concerns, please perform the following steps as soon as possible:

#### For Escalated Tickets (tickets already with the DXPC Engineering Teams)
1. **Determine if there is a deadline or major event contributing to the increased "heat"**
	- The first thing we need to do is ask the customer why the ticket is considered to be hot and report this information to your local CAS/Success/Lead/RSM(depending on your region).

2. **Report increased "heat" internally so that the team can properly prioritize**
	- The next step is for the CAS/Success/Lead/RSM to reach out to the DXPC escalation lead(Justin Bowman) and request prioritization.

3. **Inform the customer of the increased priority**
	- Let the customer know that we've prioritized the issue and that it will be treated as such. In addition, we should increase the frequency of our communication with the customer so that they know we are being sensitive to their situation.

#### For Help Center Tickets
If the ticket hasn't yet been escalated(LCH), the [standard escalation process](https://grow.liferay.com/people/DXP+Cloud+Standard+Escalation) should be expedited so that the above process can be performed(testing, reaching out to EE, creating LCH).

### Additional Information
Please reach out to the DXPC escalation lead or your local RSM if you have any questions regarding this process.
